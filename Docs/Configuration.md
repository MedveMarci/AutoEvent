# Changing configs

A List of Events and a list of config options they support.

## General

All configs have shared options that are present in any config. If use improperly or contains parameters outside the
scope of the event, it may break the event.

### Available Shared Options:

| Option Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Available Maps              | Allows you to specify a map or list of maps to choose from for the event to use. **Some events require custom components in the event to work, such as versus.** |
| Available Sounds            | Allows you to specify an audio or list of audios to choose from for the event to use.                                                                            |
| Event Friendly Fire Autoban | Allows you to manually specify whether or not the friendly fire autoban should be enabled / disabled.                                                            |
| Event Friendly Fire         | Allows you to manually specify whether friendly fire should be allowed for an event.                                                                             |
| Debug                       | Should debug mode be enabled for this plugin. For any built in plugins, this option is ignored, and the base config option is used instead.                      |                       |

#### What does list mean?

This means that you can add multiple audio files and schematics to your config at the same time.

```
available_sounds:
- This is the first item in the list
- This is the second item in the list
```

The structures of the elements will be presented below. You can copy and paste them as I indicated here. A minus sign
indicates a new object.

plugins will just use whatever the default server value is. ***This feature works with CedMod.***
