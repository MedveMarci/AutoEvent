# Example :bulb:

### If you want to learn how to write your own mini-games, then you should study the structure of mini-games.

### The basic structure:

Use the ***Event*** interface to inherit all the important methods and variables for the mini-game to work.

```csharp
public class Plugin : Event
{
}
```   

##### Also inherit ***IEventMap*** to launch schematic maps and

***IEventSound*** to launch music (See the detailed description below).

#### Event Information:

Information about the event that users can see.

```csharp
public override string Name { get; set; } = "Example";
public override string Description { get; set; } = "An example event based on the battle event.";
public override string Author { get; set; } = "KoT0XleB";
public override string CommandName { get; set; } = "example";
public override Version Version { get; set; } = new Version(1, 0, 0);
```        

#### Event Configs:

Settings you have access to that will change functionality of the event.

```csharp
// Enter your config here, which is located in the folder with your mini-game
[EventConfig]
public Config Config { get; set; }

// Custom translations have not been made yet.
public Translate Translate { get; set; } = AutoEvent.Singleton.Translation.Translate;
```

#### Event Settings:

Settings you have access to that will change functionality of the event.

```csharp
// How long to wait after the round finishes, before the cleanup begins. Default is 10 seconds.
public override float PostRoundDelay { get; protected set; } = 10f; 

// If using LabApi or Exiled as the base plugin, set this to false, and manually add your plugin to Event.Events (List[Events]).
// This prevents double-loading your plugin assembly.
public override bool AutoLoad { get; protected set; } = true;

// Used to safely kill the while loop, without have to forcible kill the coroutine.
public override bool KillLoop { get; protected set; } = false;

// How many seconds the event waits after each ProcessFrame().
protected override float FrameDelayInSeconds { get; set; } = 1f;
```

#### Event Variables:

Variables you can use that are automatically managed by the framework.

```csharp
// The coroutine handle of the main event thread which calls ProcessFrame().
protected override CoroutineHandle GameCoroutine { get; set; }

// The DateTime (UTC) that the plugin started at. 
public override DateTime StartTime { get; protected set; }
        
// The elapsed time since the plugin started. (Default)
public override TimeSpan EventTime { get; protected set; }
```

#### Event API Methods

All the necessary methods for work are presented here. Combine them as you like.

```csharp
// Used to register events for plugins.
protected override void RegisterEvents() { }

// Used to unregister events for plugins.
protected override void UnregisterEvents() { }

// Called when the event is started.
protected override void OnStart();

// Called after start in a coroutine. Can be used as a countdown coroutine.
protected override IEnumerator<float> BroadcastStartCountdown()

// Called after BroadcastStartCountdown is finished. Can be used to remove walls, or give players items.
protected override void CountdownFinished()

// Used to determine whether the event should end or not. 
// Returns true if the round is finished. False if the round should continue running.
protected abstract bool IsRoundDone();

// It is called as many times per second as is set in the FrameDelayInSeconds.
protected override void ProcessFrame() { }

// Called when the event is finished. If the event is stopped via OnStop, this won't be called, as the event never truly finishes properly.
protected abstract void OnFinished();

// Called if the event is forcibly stopped. If this is called, OnFinished won't be called.
protected override void OnStop() { }

// The overridable class for after and event is finished / stopped and cleanup is occuring.
protected virtual void OnCleanup() { }
```

#### Event maps and music

Use IEventMap and IEventSound to inherit important variables.

```csharp
public class Plugin : Event, IEventSound, IEventMap
{
    public MapInfo MapInfo { get; set; } = new MapInfo()
    { 
        MapName = "SchematicName", // Enter the name of your schematic
        Position = new Vector3(0, 0, 0), // A position for your schematics
        IsStatic = true // Always use true to optimize tps
    };
    public SoundInfo SoundInfo { get; set; } = new SoundInfo()
    { 
        SoundName = "MusicName.ogg",  // Enter the name of your music
        Volume = 10, // It is recommended to set the value for music from 5 to 10.
        Loop = true // It make music endless
    };
}
```

#### Loader Custom Mini-Games

##### Creating mini-games is not so difficult if you are using a loader of custom mini-games:

###### Start a project in Visual Studio with a class library .NetFramework 4.8

###### Paste the compiled dll mini-game into the folder:

###### Exiled -> ``EXILED\Configs\AutoEvent\Events``

###### NWApi -> ``LabApi\configs\AutoEvent\Events``

##### Do not forget to set ``IsDebug = true`` in the config and check the launch of your mini-game.
